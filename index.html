        <h4>Spatial</h4>
        <p>A map of Colorado Zayo Buildings and each of their respective products, color mapped.</p>

        <h4>Non-Spatial</h4>
        <p>A barchart displays the CPQ NPVs across buildings, using color to represent whether the building
          is already on the Zayo network or not. Interactions include detailed NPV information on hover, and
          each bar can be clicked to reveal detailed information about that particular building.
        </p>

        <h4>Non-Spatial #2</h4>
        <p>A visualization that compares how much money Zayo is currently making per product group and how much
           money they could be making per product group.
        </p>

        <h2 align="center">Design Process</h2>
        <h4>Spatial</h4>
        <p>
          We first created a prototype using pen and paper. We knew that we wanted to represent a region using the
          coordinates given to us by Zayo, and map it to another attribute in the data set that could show meaning.
          We first used D3.js as a starting point for our map, but after some trial and error, we found that D3 doesn't do a lot for you.
          Although D3 is a very powerful visualization tool, it is desinged for customization and has a steep learning curve.
        </p>
        <p>Caleb suggested a different visualization library called Leaflet.js</p>
        <p>This is an open-source Javascript library for creating mobile-friendly interactive maps.</p>
        <p>
          We chose to represent industry of building with color and we plotted them within the Denver scope. We chose to zoom
          into this level because plotting all these points to show all regions of the data from GA, CO, and TX wouldn't be beneficial
          because it would be too zoomed out to recognize any discernable patterns.
        </p>

        <h4>Non-Spatial</h4>
        <p>
          We began exploring the data by loading it into a WSYWIG tool (Tableau) to see what attributes were available to us
          across the datasets. After gaining a better understanding of the data Zayo more interested in, we were able to narrow
          down the datasets we wanted to use and how we wanted to group and display the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the bar chart is built with D3, part of the refining process came naturally as a result of better
          understanding how D3 works and what it is capable of. After building the basic bar chart, we narrowed
          down some data attributes that Zayo finds compelling and decided to integrate them into our vis through
          interaction. Like Dan and Taylor, we narrowed the results to the state of Colorado in order to better
          display some of the high-value CPQs that Zayo should be concerned with.
        </p>

        <h4>Non-Spatial #2</h4>
        <p>
          At first I was looking through the data given to us and kept in mind that I want to show as much
          business insight as possible. I wanted an easy to "read" or easy to understand representation.
          One where the user (Zayo) could easily get all the necessary details in order to execute a plan
          in order to maximize profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was thinking that a pie chart would work best here, at first. After some thought I decided
          that a bar graph would still be best to use. Some product groups like SONET and zColo would get
          too overshadowed by the other products that when put onto a pie chart, it would be really hard to
          see. In a bar chart however, you can clearl see the differences between the product groups. I was
          thinking about narrowing down the data to just CO as well but then I decided to just take in all the data.
